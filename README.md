# Goose & Bun

This is a simple game/demo for the GameBoy Advance. I'm using it to build a GBA toolkit.

## Gameplay

You are a goose. You can walk around. If you hold B, you can run. If you hold B while standing still, you flap your wings.

You are standing in your goose field. Unfortunately, some pesky buns have made a home in your field. You hate buns. You want to chase the buns back into their hole.
